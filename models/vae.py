        For each training sample (we get 128 batched at a time)

        - take the current learned mu, stddev for each of the ZDIMS
          dimensions and draw a random sample from that distribution
        - the whole network is trained so that these randomly drawn
          samples decode to output that looks like the input
        - which will mean that the std, mu will be learned
          *distributions* that correctly encode the inputs
        - due to the additional KLD term (see loss_function() below)
